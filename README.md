# IdentityGuard

IdentityGuard is a decentralized identity management system built on blockchain technology, providing users with full control over their personal information while ensuring privacy and security. The project leverages Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology powered by Noir by Aztech for enhanced privacy features. Smart contracts are deployed and verified(on scrollscan) on the Scroll Sepolia testnet for testing and development.
Here are the contract addresses:
Zk_contract : 0x604A2dbb539da644d4264866a10A24deA79e91d4
DecentralizedIdentity: 0xE2F9eDFb8D9Ef8fb5f81df1460A3858043815BC1

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Users can register their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and manage their personal information securely.

- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can selectively disclose information to third parties while maintaining control over their data.

- **Credential Issuance**: IdentityGuard supports the issuance and verification of credentials, enabling users to prove their identity and qualifications.

- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: Noir By Aztech**: Leveraging ZK technology, IdentityGuard ensures that sensitive information remains private and secure.


## Getting Started

To get started with IdentityGuard, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Deploy the smart contracts on the Scroll Sepolia testnet using Truffle or a similar tool.

3. **Configure Client**: Update the client application to connect to the deployed smart contracts on the Scroll Sepolia testnet.

4. **Start the Application**: Start the application to begin managing decentralized identities and credentials.

## Usage

IdentityGuard provides a user-friendly interface for managing decentralized identities and credentials. Users can register, update, and verify their information using the application.
